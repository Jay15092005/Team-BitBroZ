# 🔍 AI-Powered Big Data Query Assistant

## 🧩 Problem Statement

In today’s data-driven world, organizations collect an enormous amount of data. However, most of this data remains underutilized because:

- Non-technical users (like business teams, managers, or educators) struggle to extract useful insights.
- Manually analyzing large datasets is slow, difficult, and prone to error.
- Relying on data teams for every question causes major delays in decision-making.
- Traditional AI tools can't handle direct analysis of large datasets due to their size and complexity.

This results in **missed opportunities**, **slower decisions**, and **underused data potential**.
