## 🧩 Problem Statement

Today, Companies And Organizations Collect A Huge Amount Of Data. But Most Of This Data Is Not Used Properly Because:

- People Who Are Not Technical (Like Business Teams Or Teachers) Find It Hard To Understand Or Use The Data.  
- Looking Through Big Data Manually Takes A Lot Of Time And Is Difficult.  
- Teams Have To Wait For Data Experts To Write Queries And Give Answers, Which Causes Delays.  
- Normal AI Tools Can’t Work Directly With Very Large Data Due To Their Limits.  

This Leads To **Missed Chances**, **Slow Decisions**, And **Data Not Being Used Fully**.
